# Farset Labs Bible

This is a Markdown focused repository for documenting the technical operations of Farset Labs infrastructure, systems, and integrations. 

All documents should use relative linking.

It's entirely possible this will be torn down and imported into a proper wiki system, but :man_shrugging:

This is *not* a configuration management system, but is a handbook for operating and maintaining the digital infrastructure of the space/community
