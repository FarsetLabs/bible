# Laser Safe Materials

Lasers are fun, but not everything can or should be used for laser cutting/engraving. 

For all our collective safety, sanity, and security, this is the canonical list of materials/settings that can be used with the Glowforge laser cutter.

If you want to change or add to this list, raise a PR, discuss it in #laser-cutter in the [Slack](https://slackin.farsetlabs.org.uk) and make your case.
