# Workshop Induction

The workshop induction program is there to ensure a new users can use the [Workshop Equipment](equipment.md) safely and effectively.

The majority of advanced manufacturing equipment was paid for by the dues of fellow members, and some of that equipment can be dangerous if misused or neglected, so should be treated with respect and care.

## Who can be inducted to use the workshop?

* Farset Labs Members
* Guests of a Named Farset Labs Member

## Who can induct people into the use of the Workshop

* Currently [Inducted](inducted.md) Farset Labs Members

(Guests cannot induct others)

## General Workshop Guidance

* Tidy up after yourself
* If the space is not tidy before you start work, tidy it anyway
  * Passive-aggressively shaming prior users is optional... but keep calm and [AGF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith)
* Put any tools/equipment back where they belong
  * Not all tools have an obvious place where they should live, in which case, leave them back where you found them
  * If you think there is a better place to put a particular tool, or a better way to arrange things, discuss it in the #facilities room on [Slack](https://slackin.farsetlabs.org.uk)
* Do not enter the workshop while under the influence of alcohol, recreational drugs, or medication that may impair your ability to work safely
* If someone else is working in the workshop, ask if your planned work would impair their current work (first come first serve principle)

### General Induction Checklist

- [ ] Knows where the fire extinguishers are
- [ ] Knows where the first aid kits / eye wash kits are located
- [ ] Is aware of the conditions and requirements for inducting other people
- [ ] Is aware that it is their responsibility to stop and remove non-inducted people from working in the workshop

## Laser Cutter

The GlowForge Pro is a Class 4 laser product, emitting enough infrared light to cause instant skin and eye injury, or start a fire. 

This infrared light is invisible.

The Unit has a case and glass lid that block harmful levels of infrared and UV light, allowing the unit to be operated safely without additional protections.

**If there appears to be any damage to the glass or the case, do not use the laser cutter and notify the management team immediately**

Safety interlock switched on the front door turn off the laser immediately if the lid is opened. **Do not place magnetic or electromagnetic materials near the lid or doors**

### The Rules

* **Do not** leave the laser cutter unattended when in operation
  * Most cuts are relatively fast anyway (<30min for A4 engraving) 
* **Do not** put **any** material in the laser cutter bed that you are not **positive** is [laser safe](laser_safe_materials.md)
* **Do not** touch the head or arm of the laser cutter while the power is on; if you do by accident, restart the unit to prevent possible damage
* **Do not** attempt to service, repair, modify, 'improve' or dismantle the unit
* **Do not** attempt to access the internal wiring or any other sealed portion of the unit
* **Do not** stack materials (i.e. to cut multiple 'copies' simultaneously) as this is a fire hazard
* **Do not** place anything on top of the cutting bed of the unit
  * Devices like phones, cameras and small items can safely be placed on the sides of the unit, but nothing should be placed on the glass door of the unit
* If anything appears 'strange' in the use of the laser, turn it off at the emergency stop and email admin@farsetlabs.org.uk immediately.

## Laser Flaring

On the subject of laser flaring; it is normal for a small, 'candle-like' flare to be emitted from materials as the laser beam strikes them. This flare should move with the laser and should not remain lit once the laser has moved past. **If there is a lasting flame or significant smoking inside the unit** the following procedure **must** be executed.

1. Hit the emergency stop mushroom button at the back of the unit
2. If it is safe to do so, put the fire out with a damp towel
3. If it is not safe to do so, or a damp towel is not immediately available, use a fire extinguisher.
4. If the fire is not safely extinguished or spreads beyond the unit, leave the area, closing any doors behind you, and call the emergency services
5. Even if a fire is safely extinguished, notify management and do not attempt to use the unit

## Materials Conditions

As previously stated, **do not use non-approved materials in the laser**.

* Materials must be no wider than 54cm (21in.)
* Materials must be less than 13mm thick (½ in.)
  * The crumb tray can be removed to expand this to 50mm (2 in.), but should be avoided...
* Materials must be flat so they rest on the crumb tray with a flat upper surface

## The Context

The [GlowForge](https://glowforge.com/our-products/pro) was half-funded by the [Halifax Foundation](https://www.halifaxfoundationni.org/programmes/community-grant-programme) under their Communuity Grants programme, where £4000 of the £7000 necessary funding required to get the laser cutter. The remainder was made up from general charity funds for the following purposes: 

* Provide Laser Cutting Facility available to the community
* Generate and Deliver Education and Safety Training to at least 50 individuals in the local community in 2020/2021 (Including CoderDojo-suitable activities)
* Publication of >5 "Build Guides"

The initially stated measure of success of the grant were:

* Total Hours of Operation
* Total External Booking Hours
* Number of Inducted Persons 
* Number of Published Build-Guides

The inline power monitor (ESPURNA-B60BBA) is used to monitor the usage of the laser cutter. It is in the 'fixed-on' configuration so power should be switched from the rear of the laser-cutter.

### The Induction Checklist

Induction is certified by completing the following tasks (under supervision)

- [ ] Is aware of the location of and use of the power switch for the laser
- [ ] Has had their [Glowforge Account](https://app.glowforge.com/) added to the printer by someone with access to the admin@farsetlabs.org.uk account?
- [ ] Has designed and cut a design that incorporates at least one element of each of the below on an uncertified material (Cardboard ideally, nametags are great for this task)
  - [ ] Engraving
  - [ ] Scoring
  - [ ] Cutting
- [ ] Is aware of the proper operation of the fume extraction system
- [ ] Is aware of the [Laser Safe Materials](laser_safe_materials.md) list

## 3D Printers

* **Avoid** leaving the 3D printer unattended when in operation
  * For long 3D prints (on the order of hours), do not leave the building, check in on the print at least once every 15 minutes, and preferably, work from the event space if you want to leave the workshop
* **Do not** leave the 3D printer unattended at the start of a print 
  * Most mistakes/failures happen or are evident in the first 5-10 layers of a print
